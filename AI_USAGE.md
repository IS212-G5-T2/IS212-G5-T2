# AI Usage Log

Use this file to record meaningful AI-assisted work in this repository. The goal is coordination: if Codex, Claude, another AI tool, or a teammate changes the repo, future contributors should be able to see what was touched, why, and what assumptions were made.

Keep entries concise. Do not paste long prompts, private conversations, credentials, tokens, secrets, personal data, or production data.

## Entry Template

- Summary: <what changed and why>
- AI contribution: <analysis, code, tests, docs, review, migration, etc.>
- Assumptions: <important assumptions made, or None>

## Entries

## 2026-09-07 - Codex - Resolve security workflow annotations

- Issue/PR: Unknown
- Human requester/operator: swr
- Areas touched: `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`, `AI_USAGE.md`
- Summary: Fixed security workflow annotations by updating GitHub workflow checkout steps to `actions/checkout@v7`, correcting the Trivy action pin to `aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.36.0`, and replacing the licensed Gitleaks Action wrapper with the pinned Gitleaks CLI Docker image `ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.30.1`.
- AI contribution: CI workflow repair and validation.
- Assumptions: The repository should keep a free secret scan that works for an organization-owned GitHub repository without requiring `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`.
- Checks run: Verified available Trivy, checkout, and Gitleaks tags with `git ls-remote`; parsed all GitHub Actions workflow YAML files with Ruby YAML.
- Follow-up/conflict notes: None.

## 2026-09-07 - Codex - Branch promotion CI guard

- Issue/PR: Unknown
- Human requester/operator: swr
- Areas touched: `.github/workflows/branch-flow.yml`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ci-cd-process.md`, `AI_USAGE.md`
- Summary: Added a GitHub Actions check that requires pull requests into `main` to come from `staging`, and pull requests into `staging` to come from `integration`. Documented the rule in the agent guidance and CI/CD process notes.
- AI contribution: CI workflow and documentation updates.
- Assumptions: GitHub branch protection will be configured to require the `Validate Promotion Source` check where enforcement is needed.
- Checks run: Parsed all GitHub Actions workflow YAML files with Ruby YAML.
- Follow-up/conflict notes: None.

## 2026-09-07 - Codex - Jira and GitHub authority rules

- Issue/PR: Unknown
- Human requester/operator: swr
- Areas touched: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ai-issue-workflow.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `AI_USAGE.md`
- Summary: Updated AI workflow guidance so Jira is the authoritative requirements source and GitHub is the authoritative development artifact source. Added status gating, existing branch/PR reuse, Jira-key branch/commit/PR requirements, acceptance-criteria recheck, and Jira automation ownership rules.
- AI contribution: Documentation and process guidance updates.
- Assumptions: Jira statuses `To Do` and `In Progress` are the only statuses where implementation should proceed; Jira automation handles status transitions for branch creation, pull request creation, and pull request merge.
- Checks run: Reviewed updated Markdown content.
- Follow-up/conflict notes: Future AI agents should not duplicate Jira stories into GitHub Issues or manually mark Jira work items `Done`.

## 2026-09-07 - Codex - AI workflow and branch progression guidance

- Issue/PR: Unknown
- Human requester/operator: swr
- Areas touched: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ai-issue-workflow.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `AI_USAGE.md`
- Summary: Added explicit AI usage tracking and branch progression rules for normal implementation, release preparation, deployment, and hotfix work in the GitHub monorepo. Renamed the issue workflow guidance from Codex-specific wording to AI-neutral wording so all AI agents follow the same process.
- AI contribution: Documentation structure, branch-flow guidance, pull request template updates, and coordination rules for multiple AI agents.
- Assumptions: `integration` is the default target for normal work, `staging` is the default release-preparation branch, and `main` is the production/deployment branch unless a human explicitly defines a release or deployment branch.
- Checks run: Reviewed updated Markdown sections and searched relevant workflow terminology.
- Follow-up/conflict notes: Future Codex, Claude, or other AI work should add a new entry here before pull request handoff.

## 2026-09-07 - Codex - GitLab to GitHub migration cleanup

- Issue/PR: Unknown
- Human requester/operator: swr
- Areas touched: repo-wide, `.github/`, `apps/`, `services/`, `platform/`, `development/`, `docs/`
- Summary: Copied working files from the GitLab export into the GitHub repository without copying nested `.git` directories, converted GitLab CI/review metadata to GitHub Actions and pull request metadata, removed stale project-info/GitLab-only material, simplified the service template, and documented the Codex issue workflow and monorepo CI/CD process.
- AI contribution: Migration cleanup, workflow restructuring, documentation updates, repo boundary guidance, and local verification sweeps.
- Assumptions: The GitHub repository should be the single source repo; `services/template` is a scaffold rather than an implemented service; GitHub pull requests replace GitLab merge requests.
- Checks run: Verified only one `.git` directory exists; validated GitHub Actions YAML with Ruby YAML parsing; searched for stale GitLab/project-info references; checked for copied `.DS_Store`, `.terraform`, `.env`, and empty-directory leftovers.
- Follow-up/conflict notes: All migrated files are still untracked until committed. Coordinate future AI work through this log to avoid conflicting changes across Codex, Claude, or other tools.
